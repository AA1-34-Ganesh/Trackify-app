Live Server extension for Visual Studio Code
This is a VS Code extension and not a Python package, so it should be installed from the VS Code marketplace.
You can install it by searching for "Live Server" in the Extensions view in VS Code.

If you need to specify any other dependencies, list them here.
For example, if you are using any Python packages, you can list them like this:
package_name==version

Example:
flask==2.0.1
requests==2.25.1
